The AI-Based Online Attendance System is a real-time facial recognition application that automates attendance marking using a webcam. 
The user selects a folder containing reference images of individuals, and the system continuously scans for faces through the camera. 
When a recognized face appears, the system matches it with the stored images and marks attendance automatically in an Excel or CSV file.

Key Features:
âœ… Folder Selection â€“ Users can choose a folder containing reference images for recognition.
âœ… Real-Time Face Detection â€“ The system detects and recognizes faces using AI-powered facial recognition.
âœ… Live Attendance Marking â€“ When a recognized person appears on the camera, their attendance is recorded automatically.
âœ… Excel/CSV Logging â€“ Attendance data, including name and timestamp, is saved for easy tracking.
âœ… Green Rectangle Highlight â€“ The system draws a green bounding box around detected faces for visual confirmation.

This project leverages OpenCV, Python, and machine learning to provide an efficient and automated attendance management solution. ðŸš€
